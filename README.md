# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Covid-19-in-India-

* OBJECTIVE

Covid-19 is infectious disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus. Forecasting such disease over time helps us the understand 
levels and trends over time which can help to plan effective preventive measures. To forecast the confirmed cases of covid-19 in India 
time-series analysis was used.To perform time series analyis ARIMA model was used.
